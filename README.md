# RNN Multivariate Time Series Processing
Processing multivariate time series by RNN with Tensorflow

Three frameworks including:
1. acceptor
2. generalized transducer (GT)
3. encoder-decoder

solving below problems:
1. forecasting
2. embeding

Classic transducer and acceptor could be regarded as two special cases of GT. Both of them could be used for forecasting. GT and encoder-decoder can fulfill the requirement of embeding.
